  "bio": "Hey! Nice to meet ya. My name's Chris. I'm a student and an explorer (in all ways). I'm currently working my way through an undergraduate computer science degree at Northeastern University where I've learned everything from the foundations of CS to advanced algorithms, database management, software development and more. Take a look at my skills below. Outside of CS, I call myself an explorer because I chase after new experiences, some of which include rock climbing, mountaineering, music production and travel.",

At Northeastern, I'm a part of the outdoor's club (NUHOC), ski club (NU Downhillers), and the rock climbing club. I'm hoping to get into mountain biking if I have the time. My dream is to one day climb Denali. On a more technical side, I'm a huge supporter of blockchain and have recently been both trading and developing technology that interacts with cryptocurrency."
